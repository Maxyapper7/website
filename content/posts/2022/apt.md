## What is APT?

Apt is a package manager. A package manager is something that uses a thing called repositories to download and install packages. Apt is mainly used on Debian and Debian distros. And because of that apt tends to be a little bit behind and doesnâ€™t have the newest releases. Note that apt is just the program that gets and installs packages NOT the repository. 

## APT commands

### Install
```
sudo apt install <package>

#This command finds and installs packages
#This also must be run as sudo
#Ex: Sudo apt install neofetch
```
### Search
```
apt search <package>

#This command searches the repositories that you have activated
#This command does not have to be run as sudo
#Ex: Sudo apt search OpenJDK
```
### Update & Upgrade
```
sudo apt update

#This command finds any packages that need to be updated
#This command needs to be run as sudo

sudo apt upgrade

#This command updates the packages
#This also needs to be run as sudo
#Note: You have to run Sudo apt update before Sudo apt upgrade
```
### Remove & Purge
```
sudo apt remove htop

#This command removes the program
#This must be run as sudo

sudo apt purge htop

#This command completely deletes all files the program created
#This also must be run as sudo
```
### List
```
apt list --upgradable

#This shows you any packages that can be updated

apt list --installed

#This will show you any installed packages
```
### Autoremove
```
sudo apt autoremove

#This will remove any packages that aren't needed anymore
```
### Apt vs Apt-get and what to use
If you want the quick version on what to use, just use apt. Apt-get can be thought of as the backend of apt. Whereas APT is more used for humans to read. APT uses Apt-get in the background. This is simplified there are reasons why you should youse apt-get but in general use apt.
